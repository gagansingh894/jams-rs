# JAMS-CORE
This crate is part of wider project called **J.A.M.S - Just Another Model Server**. Please refer [here](https://github.com/gagansingh894/jams-rs).

This crate is the core building block of **J.A.M.S**. It provides a thin wrapper around the following models
via FFI

- Tensorflow
- Torch
- Catboost
- LightGBM

This is still a work in process and is in very early stages.
