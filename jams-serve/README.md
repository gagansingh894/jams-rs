# JAMS-SERVE

This library crate is part of a wider project called **J.A.M.S - Just Another Model Server**. Please refer [here](https://github.com/gagansingh894/jams-rs).

`jams-serve` is a http and gRPC API library for jams-core. The API is highly configurable allowing the user to select which components to use when setting up the model server.

**Currently only http is supported. This crate is in early stages and is highly unstable**
