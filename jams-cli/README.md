# JAMS-CLI
This crate is part of wider project called **J.A.M.S - Just Another Model Server**. Please refer [here](https://github.com/gagansingh894/jams-rs).

This crate provides a simple CLI for making predictions for the following models

- Tensorflow
- Torch
- Catboost
- LightGBM


This is still a work in process and is in very early stages.
